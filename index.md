Open-Source Projects by [webXcerpt Software GmbH](http://webxcerpt.com)
=======================================================================

Based on years of experience in product configuration webXcerpt has
implemented some tools that are not specific to a particular customer.
To support further development of these tools in a cooperative way we
have released them as open-source projects:

* [VClipse](/VClipse), an Eclipse-bases IDE for product modeling for the
  SAP Variant Configurator
* [openCPQ](/openCPQ), a browser-based configuration framework
